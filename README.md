<b> Epic 1: User Authentication and Profile Management </b>

<ul>
 <li>Account creation and login functionality were implemented successfully with strong password encryption and input validation. </li>
 <li>Profile management allowed users to update their personal data securely and easily. </li>
 <li>The validation mechanisms helped reduce garbage input and improved overall form reliability. </li>
</ul>


<b> Epic 2: Lab Booking System </b>

<ul>
 <li>The interface for browsing and booking labs was completed successfully with intuitive UI. </li>
 <li>Conflict handling ensured that double bookings were avoided. </li>
 <li>Confirmation messages and email-based notifications were functional and well-received during testing. </li>
</ul>


<b> Epic 3: Lab Utilization Dashboard </b>

<ul>
 <li>A clean and informative dashboard was created using data visualization libraries. </li>
 <li>Users could see booking history and usage patterns, aiding in transparency. </li>
 <li>Admins could generate usage reports to assess demand and lab occupancy trends. </li>
</ul>


<b> Epic 4: Lab Management for Administrators </b>

<ul>
 <li>Admin panel functionalities (add/edit/remove labs) worked smoothly. </li>
 <li>Proper input validation prevented invalid lab details and ensured consistency in lab data. </li>
</ul>


<b> Epic 5: Notification and Alert System </b>

<ul>
 <li>Notifications for booking confirmations and cancellations were successfully triggered via both in-app and email systems. </li>
 <li>The system ensured users were kept in the loop about changes to their bookings. </li>
</ul>


<b> Bug Density Evaluation </b>

*Calculation*:
```
Total Bugs: 18 
Total Lines of Code (LOC): 32,000 
Bug Density Formula: (Total Bugs / Total LOC) × 1000 
Result: (18 / 32,000) × 1000 = 0.5625 bugs per 1000 LOC 
```
 
<ul>
 <li>A bug density of 0.56 bugs per 1000 LOC is considered very good. </li>
 <li><b>Code Stability:</b> Indicates a reliable and robust codebase. </li>
 <li><b>Fewer Defects:</b>  Low defect rate relative to the codebase size. </li>
 <li><b>Good Testing Practices: </b> Suggests effective testing processes are in place. </li>
 <li><b>Decent Architecture:</b>  Likely reflects well-structured and maintainable code. </li>
</ul>
